= Implementing an AMQ to REST API integration

This walkthrough demonstrates customizing and extending Fuse by adding a custom data operation and adding a custom REST API client connector.

:context: amq2api
This sample integration connects to a Red Hat AMQ broker to obtain item
delivery records for a hypothetical enterprise. The integration then executes
a custom step that operates on the records to identify any
items that were damaged when they were received. After a simple data mapping,
the integration connects to
a REST API to obtain contact information for vendors of
damaged items.
