[id='amq-to-rest-api_{context}']
= Implementing an AMQ to REST API integration

This walkthrough demonstrates customizing and extending {prodname} by adding a custom data operation and adding a custom REST API client connector.

:context: amq2api
This sample integration connects to a Red Hat AMQ broker to obtain item
delivery records for a hypothetical enterprise. The integration then executes
a custom step that operates on the records to identify any
items that were damaged when they were received. After a simple data mapping,
the integration connects to
a REST API to obtain contact information for vendors of
damaged items.

[id='amq2api-create-amq-connection_{context}']
= Creating an AMQ connection

The AMQ to REST API sample integration starts by connecting to an
AMQ broker (Red Hat AMQ) that is provided in your OpenShift Online
project. Before you
start to create the integration itself, you must start the broker
and create a connection to that broker.

.Procedure

. Start the broker:

.. In a browser, go to the
https://console.fuse-ignite.openshift.com/console/[OpenShift Online Web Console].
Your {prodname} environment runs on OpenShift Online.

.. In the console, on the right, under *My Projects*, click *Fuse Online* to
display the project's overview.
+
Your project's name is something like `proj123456`.

.. In the overview, click the *>* to the left of the first entry,
*broker-amq, #1*, to expand the entry for the
provided Red Hat AMQ broker.

.. On the right, click the up caret to scale up to running 1 pod. This starts
the AMQ broker.

. Create the AMQ connection:

.. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to display any
available connections.
.. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors.
.. Click the *Red Hat AMQ* connector.
.. Configure the connection by entering:
+
... In the *Broker URL* field, enter `*tcp://broker-amq-tcp:61616*`
as the location to obtain data from.
... In the *Username* field, enter `*amq*` as the user name for
the account that accesses this AMQ broker.
... In the *Password* field, enter `*topSecret*` as the password for
the account that accesses this AMQ broker.
... Leave the other fields blank.
.. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the
connection and displays a message that indicates whether
validation is successful. If validation fails, check the values you
entered and try again.
.. When validation is successful, in the upper right, click *Next*.
.. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `*Red Hat AMQ Broker 1*`.
.. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Connection to the provided Red Hat AMQ message broker.*`
.. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *Red Hat AMQ Broker 1* is now available.

[id='amq2api-create-custom-step_{context}']
= Making a custom step available

{prodname} provides a number of steps that operate on
integration data between connections. If {prodname} does not provide a
between-connections step that meets your need,
a developer can code an extension that defines one or more
custom steps that operate on data between connections.
The developer gives you a `.jar` file that contains the extension.
You then upload the extension in {prodname} to make the custom step(s)
available for use in integrations.

The AMQ to REST API sample integration uses a custom step that
operates on data between connections to
identify items that were damaged when they were received.

.Procedure

. In a new browser tab, go to
https://github.com/syndesisio/fuse-online-sample-extension/releases.

. Download the extension’s `.jar` file.

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Customizations*.
. At the top, click *Extensions*.
. Click *Import Extension*.
. Click *Choose File* and select the downloaded `.jar` file that contains the
extension.
{prodname} validates the file, extracts and displays the extension's
ID, name, description, and type, and lists *Damage Reporter* as the custom step
that the extension defines.
. Click *Import Extension*. {prodname} makes the custom step available and displays
the list of extensions that have been imported.

.Additional resources
For information about coding an extension and creating its `.jar` file, see:

* link:{LinkToolingUserGuide}#fuseonlineextension[{NameOfToolingUserGuide} - Use Fuse toolineg to develop an extension.]

[id='amq2api-create-rest-api-connector_{context}']
= Creating a REST API connector

{prodname} can create connectors for REST APIs
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
OpenAPI 2.0 document that describes a REST API that you want to connect to.

Your {prodname} environment provides the To Do app, which has a REST API
for accessing a database that contains tasks. Your environment also provides
an OpenAPI (Swagger) document for this API.

.Procedure

. Identify the URL for your {prodname} environment's copy of the
OpenAPI document:
.. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the URL into a text editor.
.. At the beginning of the URL, insert `*todo-*`.
.. At the end of the URL, remove `dashboard` if it is present.
.. At the end of the URL, add `*swagger.json*`.
.. Use the `http` scheme instead of `https`.

+
The result is something like this:
`\http://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/swagger.json`

+
[NOTE]
Specification of `http` rather than `https` avoids a runtime error
if TLS certificates are not valid.  In production
environments, ensure that valid certificates are in place,
and always specify secure URLs (`https`) to obtain an OpenAPI document.


. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Customizations*.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
. Select *Use a URL*.
. In the input box, paste the URL for your OpenAPI document and
click *Next*.
. On the *Review Actions* page, click *Next*. If you see
a warning, you can ignore it.
. Click *Next* again to accept *HTTP Basic Authorization*.
. On the *Review/Edit Connector Details* page, {prodname} populates
the fields with values from the OpenAPI document.
.. If you want to, you can
change the values in the *Connector Name* and *Description* fields.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Host* field is correct. For example,
it should be something like this:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com`.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Base URL* field is `/api`.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
+
{prodname} displays the *API Client Connectors* tab with an entry for
the *Todo App API* that you just created.

[id='amq2api-upload-todo-app-icon_{context}']
= Uploading the To Do app icon

To show the flow of an integration, {prodname} displays icons that identify
the applications that the integration is connecting to. Your {prodname}
environment provides an icon for the To Do app. Follow these instructions
to upload it.

.Procedure

. Display the To Do app icon:

.. In a new browser tab, paste the URL for your OpenAPI document.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `swagger.json` with `images/todo_icon.png`
and click *Enter* to display the icon. For example:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/images/todo_icon.png`.

. Save the `todo_icon.png` image.

. In {prodname}, in the *API Client Connectors* tab, click the entry for
the *Todo App API* to display its details.

. On the *Connector Details* page, below the *Base URL* field, click *Edit*.

. Next to the default connector icon, click *Choose File*.

. Navigate to `todo_icon.png`, select it, and click *Open*.
The icon appears near the top of the connector details page.

. Below the *Base URL* field, click *Save*.

[id='amq2api-choose-start-connection_{context}']
= Choosing the start connection

In {prodname}, to create the sample AMQ to REST API sample integration,
the first task is to choose the start connection.

.Prerequisites
* You started the provided Red Hat AMQ broker.
* You created a connection to that message broker.

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click your
AMQ connection. If you specified the example name,
you would click *Red Hat AMQ Broker 1*.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the *Subscribe for messages* action
to receive messages from the queue you specify.
. In the *Destination Name* field, enter `*inventoryReceived*` for
the name of the queue to obtain data from.
. Click in the *Destination Type* field and select *Queue*.
. Leave the other fields blank.
. Click *Next*. {prodname} prompts you to specify the output data type.
This is not needed for this sample integration.
. Click *Done* to add the start connection to the integration.

.Next step
When the integration is running, after connecting to Red Hat AMQ, the integration watches for
messages on the `inventoryReceived` queue. When a message is available,
the integration passes it to the *Damage Reporter* step.
However, before you can add that step to the integration, you must choose the
integration's finish connection.

[id='amq2api-name-and-publish_{context}']
= Giving the integration a name and deploying it

The AMQ to REST API sample integration is complete when it has a Red Hat AMQ start
connection, a Damage Reporter step, a data mapper step, and it finishes
with a Todo App Client API connection. Follow the instructions here to
deploy it.

.Prerequisites
* You added the start and finish connections to the integration.
* You added a Damager Reporter step between the start and finish connections.
* You added a Data Mapper step between the Damage Reporter step and
the connection to the Todo App API.

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, in the upper right, click *Publish*.
. In the *Integration Name* field, enter a name for the
integration. For example, `*AMQ to REST API Sample Integration*`.
. Optionally, in the *Description* field, enter information that might be
helpful to know about this integration.
. In the upper right corner, click *Publish*.
+
{prodname} starts to deploy the integration and then displays the
list of integrations in this environment. In the entry for your AMQ to
REST API integration, you can see a progress
indicator that shows the publishing stages.
{prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes.
+
A {prodname} account is limited to a specific number of
integrations that can be running at one time. For details,
see the pricing plan. If you are already running the maximum
number of integrations, then you must stop an integration
before you can start running another one.
+
If you are using a {prodname} evaluation
account, then only one integration at a time can be running.
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Stopped* state. You must stop the running integration and
then you can then publish this integration.

. If you are already running the maximum number of integrations, follow
these steps to stop an integration:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right.
.. In the popup, click *Stop*.

. After stopping an integration, start another integration as follows:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click

you can confirm that it works as defined.

.Prerequisite
In {prodname}, in the list of integrations,
*Running* appears next to the AMQ to REST API
integration that you created and deployed.

.Procedure

. In a new browser window, go to the To Do app display by
inserting `*todo-*` in front of the URL
for your {prodname} environment. For example:
`\https://todo-app-proj761432.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/`.
. In the To Do app display, click *Show JMS Form* to display an
input box that contains an XML message.
. Click *Send JMS Message* to send that message
to the Red Hat AMQ broker in your OpenShift project.
+
Successful execution returns a task from the To Do app client API. The task
identifies the ID of the damaged item and the contact information for its
vendor. If the task does not appear in a moment or two, try reloading the
page.
. Edit the XML message to specify two damaged items:
.. Click *Show JMS Form* to display the message input box again.
.. In the XML message, change the entry for the undamaged item to
specify `damaged="true"`.
.. Click *Send JMS Message*. The To Do app client API returns a new
task that contains IDs for two damaged items and contact information for
the two vendors.
. Edit the XML message to specify an ID that you make up:
.. Click *Show JMS Form*.
.. In the XML message, for the item that has `damaged="true"`, change the item
ID, for example, to `1234`.
.. Click *Send JMS Message*. The To Do app client API returns a new
task with the item ID that you just entered.

. Optionally, view the integration log to troubleshoot an
unexpected result or to learn more about integration execution:

.. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. Click the entry for your AMQ to REST API integration.
.. In the integration's summary page, click the *Activity* tab.
.. Click the integration execution for which you want to view activity information.
