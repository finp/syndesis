<p>A common set up is to have
a {prodname} development environment, a {prodname} test environment,
and a {prodname} deployment environment.
To facilitate this, {prodname} provides the ability to export an
integration from one {prodname} environment and then import that integration
into another {prodname} environment.
The information and procedures for managing integrations are the same
in each kind of {prodname} environment, unless specifically noted.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you create and publish an integration, you might want to update
what the integration does. You can edit a draft of the published integration
and then replace the running version with the updated version.
To facilitate this, for each integration, {prodname} maintains multiple
versions as well as each version&#8217;s state.
An understanding of integration versions and states helps you to
manage your integrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Description of integration versions</div>
<p>In each {prodname} environment, each integration can have multiple
versions. Support for multiple integration versions has several benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you publish a version that does not work correctly, then you
can return to running a correct version of the integration. To do that, you
stop the incorrect version and start a version
that runs the way you want it to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As requirements or tools change, you can incrementally update an
integration. You do not need to create a new integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} assigns a new version number each time it starts running
a new version of an integration. For example, suppose you publish the
Twitter to Salesforce sample integration. After it has been
running, you update the integration to use a different
account to connect to Twitter. You then publish the updated integration.
{prodname} stops the running version of the integration, and
publishes the updated version of the integration with an incremented
version number.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial integration that was running
is version 1. The updated integration that is now running is
version 2. If you edit version 2, for example to
use a different account to connect to Salesforce, and you publish that
version then it becomes version 3 of the integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There can be exactly one draft version of an integration.
{prodname} has a definition for the draft version of an integration but it
has never run this version of the integration. The draft version of an integration
does not have a number. When you edit an integration,
you are updating the draft version of the integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In {prodname}, you can see a list of the versions of an integration in the
integration&#8217;s summary page. To view this page, in the left navigation
panel, click <strong>Integrations</strong>. In the entry for the integration that you
are interested in, click <strong>View</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Description of integration states</div>
<p>In {prodname}, in the list of integration versions, each entry
indicates the state of that version, which is one of the following:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you create an integration, you can save it as a draft or
publish it to start running it. When you publish
an integration, {prodname} assembles the needed resources,
builds the integration runtime, deploys the OpenShift pod that will
run the integration, and then starts running the integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any time, you can click a button to stop running the integration.
When you want to start the integration again, {prodname} already
has what it needs so starting it takes less time
than when you published it to run it for the first time.</p>
