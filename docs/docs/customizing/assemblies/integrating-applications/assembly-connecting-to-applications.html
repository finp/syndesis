<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a connection, you
select the connector for the application that you want to connect to
and then enter values in input fields to configure a connection to that application.
The configuration details that you need to provide vary for each application.
After configuring the connection, you give it a name that helps you
distinguish it from any other connections to the same application.
Optionally, you can specify a description of the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use the same connector to create any number of connections to that
application. For example, you might use the AMQ connector to create
three different connections. Each AMQ connection could specify a
different broker.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an integration, you might want to connect to an application that uses
the OAuth protocol to authenticate access requests. To do this,
you must register your installation of {prodname} for access to that application.
Registration authorizes all connections from your {prodname} installation
to a given application. For example, if you register your {prodname}
installation with Salesforce, all connections from your {prodname}
installation to Salesforce use the same Salesforce client ID and the same
Salesforce client secret that registration provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In each {prodname} environment, for each application that uses OAuth,
only one registration of {prodname} as a client is required. This
registration lets you create multiple connections and each connection can
use different user credentials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the specific steps vary for each OAuth application that you want to connect to,
registration always provides your {prodname} environment with a client ID and
a client secret. Some applications use other labels for the client ID
and client secret. For example, Salesforce generates a consumer key and
a consumer secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some OAuth applications, {prodname} provides an entry in its <strong>Settings</strong>
page for adding the client ID and client secret that registration provides. To see which
applications this applies to, in the left panel of {prodname}, click
<strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Prerequisites</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the {prodname} <strong>Settings</strong> page, there is an entry for the application

<div class="olist arabic">
<div class="title">Procedure overview</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In the {prodname} <strong>OAuth Application Management</strong> page, expand the entry for the
application with which you want to register {prodname}.
This displays the client ID and client secret fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Near the top of the <strong>OAuth Application Management</strong> page, where you see
<code><strong>During registration, enter this callback URL:</strong></code>, copy that URL to the
clipboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In another browser tab, go to the web site for the application that you
want to register with and perform the steps that are required to obtain
a client ID and secret. One of these steps requires you to enter
the callback URL for your {prodname} environment. Paste the
URL that you copied to the clipboard in the second step.</p>

<li>
<p>In {prodname}, on the <strong>Settings</strong> page, paste the

<h2 id="about-connection-validation_connections"><a class="anchor" href="#about-connection-validation_connections"></a>About connection validation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After obtaining authorization for {prodname} to access an application
that uses OAuth, you can create one or more connections
to that application.
When you create a connection to an OAuth application,
{prodname} validates it to confirm that
authorization is in place. At any time, you can validate the connection again to
ensure that authorization is still in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some OAuth applications grant access tokens that have an expiration date.
If the access token expires, you can reconnect to the application to
obtain a new access token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To validate a connection that uses OAuth or to obtain a new access token
for an OAuth application:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In the left panel, click <strong>Connections</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the connection that you want to validate or for which you want to
obtain a new access token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the connection&#8217;s details page, click <strong>Validate</strong> or click
<strong>Reconnect</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If validation or reconnection fails, then check with the application/service provider to
determine if the application&#8217;s OAuth keys, IDs, tokens, or secrets are still
valid. It is possible that an item has expired or been revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find that an OAuth item is invalid, has expired, or been
revoked, obtain new values and paste them into the {prodname} settings
for the application. See the instructions in
<a href="{LinkSyndesisConnectorGuide}">{NameOfSyndesisConnectorGuide}</a>
for registering the application whose connection did not validate. With the
updated settings in place, follow the instructions above to try to
validate the updated connection. If validation is successful, and there
is a running integration that is using this connection, restart
the integration. To restart an integration, stop it and then start it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If validation fails and reconnection fails but everything appears to
be valid at the service provider, then try reregistering
your {prodname} environment with the application and then recreate the
connection. {prodname} validates the connection when you recreate it.
If you recreate the connection, and there is an integration that is
using the connection, then you must edit the integration to delete the old
connection and add the new connection. If the integration is running,
then you must stop it and restart it.</p>

<h2 id="about-adding-connections-to-integrations_connections"><a class="anchor" href="#about-adding-connections-to-integrations_connections"></a>About adding connections to integrations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you add a connection to a simple integration or to
an operation flow, {prodname} displays a list
of the actions that the connection can perform when it connects to the
application. You must select exactly one action. In a running integration,
each connection performs only the action you choose. For example, when you
add a Twitter connection as an integration&#8217;s start connection, you might
choose the <strong>Mention</strong> action, which monitors Twitter for tweets that
mention your Twitter handle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Selection of some actions prompts you to specify one or more parameters,
which configure the action.
For example, if
you add a Salesforce connection to an integration and choose the <strong>On create</strong>
action then you must indicate the type of object whose creation you are
interested in, such as a lead or a contact.</p>

<h2 id="viewing-and-editing-connection-information_connections"><a class="anchor" href="#viewing-and-editing-connection-information_connections"></a>How to view and edit connection information</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you create a connection, {prodname} assigns an internal identifier to
the connection. This identifier does not change. You can
change the connection&#8217;s name, description, or configuration values and
{prodname} recognizes it as the same connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two ways to view and edit information about a connection:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the left panel, click <strong>Connections</strong> and then click any connection to
view its details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left panel, click <strong>Integrations</strong> and then view any integration
to see its summary page. In the integration&#8217;s flow diagram:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a simple integration, click a
connection icon to view that connection&#8217;s details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an API provider integration, click view
<span class="image"><img src="../../../_images/images/integrating-applications/ApiProviderReturnIcon.png" alt="flows icon"></span> to display the integration&#8217;s
operation list. Click the operation whose flow contains the connection
that you want to view details for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the <strong>Connection Details</strong> page, for the connection that you want to edit, click
<span class="image"><img src="../../../_images/images/integrating-applications/PencilForEditing.png" alt="Edit"></span> next to a field to edit that field.
Or, for some connections, below the configuration fields, click <strong>Edit</strong> to
change configuration values. If you change any values, be sure to click
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you update a connection that is used in an integration that is running,
you must republish the integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For connections to applications that use the OAuth protocol to authorize
access, you cannot change the login credentials that the connection uses.
To connect to the application and use different login credentials, you
must create a new connection.</p>

<h2 id="creating-connections-from-custom-connectors_connections"><a class="anchor" href="#creating-connections-from-custom-connectors_connections"></a>About creating a connection from a custom connector</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you upload an extension that defines a custom connector, the
custom connector is available for use. You use custom connectors
to create connections
in the same way that you use {prodname}-provided connectors to
create connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A custom connector might be for an application that uses the OAuth
protocol. Before you create a connection from this kind of connector, you must
register your {prodname} environment for access to the application
that the connector is for. You do this in the interface for the application
that the connector is for. The details for how to register your
{prodname} environment vary for each application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose the custom connector is
for creating connections to Yammer. You would need to register your
{prodname} environment by creating a new application within Yammer.
Registration provides a
Yammer client ID for {prodname}
and a Yammer client secret value for {prodname}.
A connection from your {prodname} environment to Yammer
must provide these two values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that an application might use different
names for these values, such as consumer ID or consumer secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you register your {prodname} environment, you can create
a connection to the application. When you configure the connection,
there should be parameters for entering the client ID and the client
secret. If these parameters are not available, you need to talk with
the extension developer and ask for an updated extension that lets
you specify the client ID and client secret.</p>
