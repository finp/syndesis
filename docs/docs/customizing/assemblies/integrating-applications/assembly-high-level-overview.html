<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With {prodname}, you can obtain data from an
application or service, operate on that data if you need to, and then
send the data to a completely different application or service.  No coding is
required to accomplish this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following topics provide a high-level overview of {prodname}:</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works_high"><a class="anchor" href="#how-it-works_high"></a>How {prodname} works</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} provides a web browser interface that lets you integrate two or
more different applications or services without writing code. It also provides
features that allow you to introduce code if it is needed for complex
use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} lets you enable data transfer between different applications.
For example, a business analyst can use {prodname} to capture
tweets that mention customers and then leverage the data obtained from
Twitter to update Salesforce accounts. Another example is a service
that makes stock trade recommendations. You can use {prodname} to
capture recommendations for buying or selling stocks of interest
and forward those recommendations to a service that automates stock transfers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create and run a simple integration, the main steps are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create a connection to each application that you want to integrate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the start connection. This connection is to the application that
contains the data that you want to share with another application.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you can start the integration with a timer or a webhook
that accepts an HTTP request.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the finish connection. This connection is to the application
that receives data from the start connection and that completes the
integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Map data fields from the start connection to data fields in the
finish connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the integration a name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Publish</strong> to start running the integration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another kind of integration is an API provider integration.
An API provider integration allows REST API clients to invoke
commands that trigger execution of the integration. To create
and run an API provider integration, you upload an OpenAPI 3 (or 2)
document to {prodname}. This document specifies the operations
that clients can call. For each operation, you specify and
configure the flow of connections and steps, such as data mapper
or filter steps, that executes
that operation. A simple integration has one primary flow while an
API provider integration has a primary flow for each operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The {prodname} dashboard lets you monitor and manage integrations. You can
see which integrations are running, and you can start, stop, and edit integrations.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="user-types_high"><a class="anchor" href="#user-types_high"></a>Who {prodname} is for</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} is for business experts in, for example,
finance, human resources, or
marketing, who do not want to write code in order
to share data between two different applications. Their use of a
variety of software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications gives them an
understanding of business requirements, workflows, and relevant data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a business user, you can use {prodname} to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Capture tweets that mention your company, filter them, and create new
contacts in your Salesforce environment when the tweet is from an unknown
source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify Salesforce lead updates and then execute a SQL stored procedure
to keep your related database up to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subscribe for orders received by an AMQ broker and then operate on
those orders with a custom API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain data from an Amazon S3 bucket and add it to a Dropbox folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are just a few examples of what a business user can do without
writing code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="benefits_high"><a class="anchor" href="#benefits_high"></a>Benefits of using {prodname}</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} has a number of benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integrate data from different applications or services without writing code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the integration on OpenShift Online in the public cloud or on
OpenShift Container Platform on site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the visual data mapper to map data fields in one application to data
fields in another application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage all the benefits of open source software. You can extend features,
and customize interfaces. If {prodname} does not provide a connector for an
application or service that you want to integrate then a developer can
create the connector that you need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="description-of-constructs_high"><a class="anchor" href="#description-of-constructs_high"></a>Descriptions of {prodname} constructs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use {prodname}, you create an
integration by working with connectors,
connections, actions, steps, and flows. It is helpful to have a basic understanding
each of these constructs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each installation of {prodname} is referred to as a {prodname} environment.
When Red Hat installs and manages your {prodname} environment, it is running
on OpenShift Online or on OpenShift Dedicated. When you install and manage
a {prodname} environment, it is usually running on OpenShift Container Platform,
but it can be running on OpenShift Dedicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Integrations</div>
<p>In {prodname}, there are simple integrations and API provider integrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple integration is a set of ordered steps that {prodname} executes.
This set includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A step that connects to an application to start the integration. This
connection provides the initial data that the integration
operates on. A subsequent connection can provide additional data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A step that connects to an application to complete the integration. This
connection receives any data that was output from previous steps
and finishes the integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional additional steps that connect to applications
between the start and finish
connections. Depending on the position of the additional connection
in the sequence of integration steps, an additional connection can
do any or all of the following:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide additional data for the integration to operate on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process the integration data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output processing results to the integration</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional steps that operate on data between connections to
applications. Typically,
there is a step that maps data fields from the previous connection to
data fields that the next connection uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An API provider integration publishes a REST API service for which you
provided an OpenAPI schema. A call from a REST API client triggers execution
of an API provider integration. The call can invoke any operation that the
REST API implements. While a simple integration has one primary flow of execution,
an API provider integration has a primary flow for each operation. Each operation
flow connects to the applications and processes the data according to the
steps that you added to that operation&#8217;s flow when you created the integration.
Each operation flow ends by returning a response that you specify
to the client whose call triggered execution of the integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Connectors</div>
<p>{prodname} provides a set of connectors. A connector represents a specific
application that you want to obtain data from or send data to.
Each connector is a template
for creating a connection to that specific application. For example, you use the
Salesforce connector to create a connection to
Salesforce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An application that you want to connect to might use the OAuth protocol
to authenticate users. In this case, you register your {prodname} environment
as a client that can access that application. The registration is associated with the
connector for that application. You need to register a particular {prodname}
environment only once with each
application that uses OAuth. The registration extends to each
connection that you create from that connector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If {prodname} does not provide a connector that you need, a developer
can create the required connector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Connections</div>
<p>Before you can create an integration, you must create a connection
to each application or service
that you want to obtain data from or send data to.
To create a connection,
you select a connector and add configuration information.
For example, to connect to an AMQ broker in an integration, you create
a connection by selecting the AMQ connector,
and then following prompts to identify the broker to connect to and the
account to use for the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A connection is one specific instance of the connector that
it is created from. You can create any number of connections
from one connector. For example,
you can use the AMQ connector to create three AMQ connections where
each connection accesses a different broker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a simple integration, you select a connection to start the integration,
a connection to end the integration, and optionally one or more
connections for accessing additional applications.
To create an API provider integration, you can add one or more connections
to each operation flow.
Any number of integrations and operation flows can use the same connection. A particular
integration or flow can use the same connection more than once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For details, see
<a href="{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#connecting-to-applications_ug">About connections to applications that you want to integrate</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Actions</div>
<p>In an integration, each connection performs exactly one action. As you create an
integration, you choose a connection to add to the flow and then you
choose the action that the connection performs. For example, when you
add a Salesforce connection to a flow, you choose from
a set of actions that includes, but is not limited to,
creating a Salesforce account, updating a Salesforce account, and
searching Salesforce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some actions require additional configuration and {prodname}
prompts you for this information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Steps</div>
<p>A simple integration is a set of ordered steps. In an API provider
integration, each operation flow is a set of ordered steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each step operates on data.
Some steps operate on data while connected to an application or service
outside {prodname}. These steps are connections. Between connections, there can
be other steps that operate on data in {prodname}.
Typically, the set of steps includes a step that maps data fields used
in a previous connection to data fields that are used in the next connection
in the flow.
Except for the start connection in a simple integration,
each step operates on data it receives from the previous steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To operate on data between connections, {prodname} provides steps for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mapping data fields in one application to data fields in another
application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering data so that the integration continues only when the data
being processed meets criteria that you define.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spliting a collection of records into individual records so that
{prodname} executes subsequent steps iteratively, once for each record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregating individual records into a collection so that
{prodname} executes subsequent steps once for the collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating equivalent, consistent output by inserting data into a
Freemarker, Mustache, or Velocity template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging information in addition to the default logging that {prodname}
automatically provides.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To operate on data between connections in a way that is not built into
{prodname}, you can upload an extension that provides a custom step.
See <a href="{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#developing-extensions_custom">Developing {prodname} extensions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Flow</div>
<p>A flow is a set of ordered steps that an integration executes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple integration has one primary flow.
An API provider integration has a primary flow for each operation that the REST API
defines. Each operation&#8217;s primary flow is the set of steps that processes
a call that invokes that operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A primary flow can have conditional flows. An integration evaluates a
condition that you specify to determine whether to execute its
associated flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a flow, each step can operate on the data that is output from
the previous steps. To determine the steps that you need in a flow,
see
<a href="{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#plan_ready">Considerations for planning your integrations</a>.</p>
