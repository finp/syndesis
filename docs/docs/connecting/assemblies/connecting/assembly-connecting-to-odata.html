<p>Open Data Protocol (OData) is a standard for building and
consuming REST APIs. An OData service provides services to
clients, such as {prodname}, through OData-compliant
HTTP requests. A {prodname} integration can obtain
entities from an OData service, and can update, create, or
delete entities managed by an OData service. To do this, create an
OData connection, and add it to an integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is assumed that you are familiar with the
<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html">OData specification</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Details for connecting to an OData service are in the following topics:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an integration, to obtain, update, create, or delete
entities that are managed by an OData service, you must first create a connection to
that OData service.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Prerequisites</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must know the base URL for the OData service that you want
to connect to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that service uses authentication then you must have the
required credentials, and, if required, an SSL certificate.
However, most OData services are public and do not require
authentication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<div class="title">Procedure</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In {prodname}, in the left panel, click <strong>Connections</strong> to
display any available connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Create Connection</strong> to display
connectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>OData</strong> connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To configure the connection:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Service Root URL</strong> field, enter the base URL for the
OData service that you want to access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>User Name</strong> field, if the service uses basic authentication,
then enter your user name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Password</strong> field, if the service uses basic authentication,
then enter your password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Server Certificate</strong> field, if the service requires it, paste the content of an SSL
certificate.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, a public OData service does not require a certificate in addition to the
certificates provided by the browser. However, for an internal OData service,
you might have created your own SSL certificate and self-signed it. Since this
certificate is not trusted by a certificate authority, connections to your OData
service would fail. To enable connections, paste the self-signed certificate here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to get the certificate is to load the service in a browser.
The steps after that depend on which browser you are using, but it will be
something like the following: click the <strong>Not secure</strong> padlock symbol next to the
address bar, then click <strong>View Certificate</strong>, export the displayed certificate to
a file, copy the certificate, and paste it into this field.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Validate</strong>. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the
connection and displays a message that indicates whether
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise the input
parameter(s) and try again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When validation is successful, click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, you might enter <code>OData North</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Description</strong> field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that <strong>OData North</strong> appears as a connection that you can
choose to add to an integration.</p>

<h2 id="adding-odata-connections-read_odata"><a class="anchor" href="#adding-odata-connections-read_odata"></a>Triggering an integration when polling returns data from an OData service</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To trigger execution of an integration upon obtaining data from an
OData service, add an OData connection to a simple integration as its start
connection. When the integration is running, the OData connection
polls the service at intervals that you specify. When the connection finds
data that satisfies the connection configuration, the connection passes
the data to the next step in the integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Prerequisite</div>
<p>You created an OData connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<div class="title">Procedure</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In the {prodname} panel on the left, click <strong>Integrations</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Create Integration</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Choose a connection</strong> page, click the OData connection that
you want to use to start the integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Choose an action</strong> page, select the <strong>Read</strong> action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the <strong>Read</strong> action:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Resource Collection</strong> field, select the name of the OData resource
that you want to query. {prodname} fetches data from the
OData service to provide a list of available resource collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Entity Key Predicate</strong> field, to obtain a particular
entity, identify the entity that you want by specifying its key predicate.
For example, specify something like <code><strong>UserName='Bob'</strong></code> or
<code><strong>Categories(1)</strong></code>. To obtain multiple entities, leave this field blank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Query Options</strong> field, enter a query that you want to
apply to the resource. Use OData syntax. For example,
<code>$filter=startswith(name, 'N')</code> returns a message for each entity in the
resource that has a <code>name</code> field that starts with <code>N</code>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can specify both <strong>Entity Key Predicate</strong> and <strong>Query Options</strong>. If you do,
the OData service obtains the specified entity and applies the query to
that entity. For example, suppose that you set <strong>Entity Key Predicate</strong> to
<code><strong>UserName='russellwhyte'/Emails</strong></code> and you set <strong>Query Options</strong> to
<code><strong>$filter=contains($it,'example')</strong></code>. The connection creates a request
that looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>https://services.odata.org/TripPinRESTierService/People(UserName='russellwhyte')/Emails?$filter=contains($it, 'example')</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service returns all email addresses for Russell Whyte that
contain the domain <code>example</code>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Filter Old Results</strong> checkbox to obtain a particular
message only once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Split Results</strong> checkbox if you want the
connection to return individual messages
rather than a collection of messages.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} also provides discrete split and aggregate steps, which
you can add to a flow.
If you want to process individual messages in one or more steps and
then aggregate the messages into a collection, do not select the
<strong>Split Results</strong> checkbox. Instead, leave the checkbox empty and then add a
split step to the flow after this connection. A split step is
required if you want an aggregate step in the flow.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Interval Before Polling Starts</strong> field, accept the default of
1 second, or enter the length of time that you want to elapse before
the connection starts to poll the OData service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Delay</strong> field, accept the default of 30 seconds, or enter
the interval at which you want the connection to poll the OData service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Backoff Idle Threshold</strong> field, accept the default of 1
or enter an integer that indicates the number of consecutive polls that
can return no data. After this number of polls, the connection increases
the interval between subsequent polls. The connection determines the new
length of the polling interval by multiplying the <strong>Delay</strong> value by the
<strong>Backoff Multiplier</strong> value.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose that the polling interval (the <strong>Delay</strong> value)
is the default of 30 seconds, <strong>Backoff Idle Threshold</strong> is set to 5, and
<strong>Backoff Multiplier</strong> is set to 12. After 5 consecutive polls that return
no data, the connection waits 360 seconds (30 x 12) before polling again.
The connection continues to poll every 360 seconds until a poll
returns data. After a poll returns data, the connection resumes
polling every 30 seconds.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Backoff Multiplier</strong> field, accept the default of 1 or enter
an integer that indicates the multiplier for increasing the polling
interval if the value set for the  <strong>Backoff Idle Threshold</strong> is reached.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you accept the default of 1 for the <strong>Backoff Multiplier</strong>, then the
connection continues to poll at the specified interval no matter how
many consecutive polls return no results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The values that you specify for <strong>Backoff Idle Threshold</strong> and
<strong>Backoff Multiplier</strong> are useful for reducing CPU overhead since the
connection can automatically poll less often during quiet periods.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Result</div>
<p>The integration now has a start connection and {prodname} is prompting
you to choose the finish connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During execution, what the connection returns depends on what you specified
in the <strong>Entity Key Predicate</strong> and <strong>Query Options</strong> fields. The OData connection can return:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A collection of entities or a collection of entity properties</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, this might be all <strong>Person</strong> entities in the resource, or
perhaps all <strong>Age</strong> properties for all <strong>Person</strong> entities. The connection
returns the collection in one message. {prodname} executes each subsequent
step in the flow once for the collection. However, when you configure the
<strong>Read</strong> action, if you select <strong>Split Results</strong>, then the connection returns
each entity or each property in its own message. {prodname} executes
each subsequent step in the flow once for each message.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>An entity or an entity property</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, this might be the <strong>Person</strong> entity whose <strong>UserName</strong> property is
<strong>Bob</strong>, or perhaps the <strong>Age</strong> property for the <strong>Person</strong> entity whose <strong>UserName</strong> is
<strong>Bob</strong>. The connection returns the entity or the entity property in a
message that it passes to the next step in the flow.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Next steps</div>
<p>Add the integration’s finish connection and any other connections that you
want to include in the integration. When the integration contains all the
connections that are needed, if the OData connection returns a collection,
consider whether you need to add a split step after the OData connection.
An integration usually needs to map the data returned by the OData connection
to fields that a subsequent connection in the flow can use. Sometimes you can
map a collection, but more often you need to split the collection in order
to map to the target fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the OData connection, add a data mapper step to the flow.
Exactly where in the flow depends on what you want the flow to do.
For example, after the OData connection, you might add a basic filter step
and then add a data mapper step.</p>

<li>
<p>Click the OData connection that you want to use. Note that when an OData
connection updates or deletes an entity, the connection does not return anything.
When the OData connection creates an entity, the connection returns the new entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Choose an action</strong> page, select the action that you want the

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Create</strong> adds an entity to an OData resource.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Delete</strong> removes an entity from an OData resource.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important for you to have an understanding of how the OData
resource that you are updating is set up. The backing data source for
an OData service determines the rules for updates and resolving conflicts.
For example, suppose an OData connection tries to create a new entity but
an entity with that predicate key already exists. The OData service might
overwrite the existing entity, or it might update some fields in the
existing entity, or it might ignore the operation. It is up to you to
know how the OData service behaves in this situation.</p>
