<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an integration, to be able to connect to Gmail, Google Calendar, or
Google Sheets,
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application.
During registration, you enable Google APIs and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access the Google APIs that you have enabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With registration in place, you can create multiple connections
to Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. You can use each connection
in multiple integrations.
While each connection to a Google application can use the
same Google client ID and Google client secret, which you obtain during registration,
each connection can access
a different Google account, which you choose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This procedure instructs you to enable the Gmail API, the Google Calendar API,
and the Google Sheets API. However, you can enable only the API(s) that you
need rather than all three APIs. At a later time, if you need to create connections
to the applications whose APIs you did not enable, you can return here and
follow the instructions to enable their APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">

<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must create a new Google client application for {prodname}.
The credentials that Google provides for a new client application contain a
refresh token that is used for refreshing expired access tokens. This refresh
token is available only the first time that the {prodname} client application
uses the credentials. In {prodname}, connections to Gmail, Google Calendar,
and Google Sheets can all use the same Google client ID and Google client
secret. If they do, the refresh token is available to all connections
to Google applications. When you view connection details in the {prodname}
user interface, do not click the <strong>Validate</strong> button. Validation is a second
use of the credentials and the refresh token is no longer part of the
client credentials. You can, however, re-connect to Google applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In development environments, be careful if you choose to use the Google client ID and Google client
secret that you are using for some other, non-{prodname}, OAuth client.
{prodname} requires offline access that is requested on the first OAuth
exchange. If another OAuth client already entered the OAuth exchange
and did not request offline access, then {prodname} cannot obtain
offline access on subsequent OAuth exchanges. If you are unsure
whether offline access was requested on the first exchange,
create a new Google client application for {prodname}.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives-for-populating-email-to-send_gmail"><a class="anchor" href="#alternatives-for-populating-email-to-send_gmail"></a>Alternatives for populating email to send</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Gmail connection that finishes a simple integration or that is
in the middle of a flow sends an email from the Gmail
account that the connection is authorized to access. There are
several ways to populate the content of the email that the connection
sends. Before you add a Gmail connection that sends an email, consider
how you want to populate that email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The alternatives for populating an email to send are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a data mapper step just before the Gmail connection that sends
an email. In this data mapper step, map data fields that are output
from previous steps to Gmail connection <strong>Send Email</strong> action fields.
The <strong>Send Email</strong> action fields are:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Email to</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email subject</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email text</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email cc</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email bcc</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you add a data mapper step then you can map one, some, or all
<strong>Send Email</strong> action fields.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you add a Gmail connection to a flow, configure the
action by specifying values
in the <strong>Send Email</strong> action fields.
You can specify values in one, some, or all fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use both a data mapper step and <strong>Send Email</strong> action configuration to
populate the fields. In other words, you can configure the
<strong>Send Email</strong> action by specifying one or more fields and
also add a data mapper step that populates other fields.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A value that you specify directly in a <strong>Send Email</strong> action
field has precedence over a value that is
mapped to the <strong>Send Email</strong> action field. In other words, suppose you populate
a <strong>Send Email</strong> field by specifying a value when you add the connection
and configure the action
and also by mapping a value to the same field. The value that you specify
in the action configuration always overrides the value that was mapped.
For example, suppose you specify
<code>people@redhat.com</code> in the <strong>Email to</strong> action field and you also map an
email field from a previous step to the Gmail <strong>Email to</strong> field. The integration
always uses <code>people@redhat.com</code> as the email address.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you add a Gmail connection that sends an email, all action configuration
parameters are optional. This is because you might choose to populate an
email entirely by mapping integration data to the <strong>Send Email</strong> action
fields. However, the presence of an email address
in the <strong>Email to</strong> field, either by action configuration specification or by
mapping, is required. Without an email address to send
the message to, {prodname} generates a runtime error and the integration
stops executing.</p>

<p>To trigger execution of an integration based on email received by
a particular Gmail account, add a Gmail connection as the start connection of
a simple integration. When the integration is running, the Gmail connection checks
this account for emails at intervals that you control.

To obtain only certain emails,
specify a comma-separated list of labels that are used in the Gmail
account that the connection is accessing. By default, the integration obtains the
unread emails that have those labels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Mark as read</strong> to ensure that the connection does not
return the same email twice. If <strong>Mark as read</strong> is not selected, the
connection returns emails that are in the account&#8217;s in box, whether or
not they were previously read. Or, if you specify one or more labels, then
the integration return emails that have those labels whether or not they
were already read.</p>

<li>
<p>In the <strong>Max Results</strong> field, accept the default of <strong>5</strong> or

<p>To configure the action:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>In the <strong>SpreadsheetId</strong> field, enter the ID of a Google spreadsheet that is
accessible from the Google account that this Google Sheets connection
is authorized to access.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To obtain a spreadsheet ID, display the spreadsheet in a browser.
The ID is the part of the URL between <code>d/</code> and <code>/edit</code>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Range</strong> field, enter Google A1 notation that identifies
the data that you want to obtain. The default is <strong>A:A</strong>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose that you want all data from a spreadsheet that
has one sheet with 4 columns. Specify <code>A:D</code>. Or, to obtain data from
rows 5 through 15, specify <code>A5:D15</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the spreadsheet from which you are
obtaining data has more than one sheet, specify the sheet name as well
as the start cell coordinate and the end cell coordinate. If there is more
than one sheet, and you do not
specify a sheet name, then the connection obtains data from the first
sheet in the spreadsheet. For example, specification of <code>2019!A1:D5</code> specifies
that you want to obtain data from the sheet whose name is <code>2019</code>. In that
sheet, you want the data that is in columns A through D for rows 1 through 5.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Major dimension</strong> field, accept <strong>Rows</strong>, which is the default, or
select <strong>Columns</strong>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Rows</strong> configures the action to return a collection
of row objects where each row object contains a value for each desired column.
When <strong>Major dimension</strong> is <strong>Rows</strong>, {prodname} can display meaningful column
headings as field names in the data mapper, rather than <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Columns</strong> configures the action to return a collection of column objects
where each column object contains a value for each desired row.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Header row number</strong> field, if <strong>Major dimension</strong> is set to <strong>Rows</strong>,
optionally enter the number of the row that contains the column headings in
the data that the connection obtains. Specification of a header row enables
{prodname} to obtain the headings from the spreadsheet. If you do not
specify a header row, column headings default to a letter heading for
each column in the range of data that the connection obtains.
You can edit obtained headings or letter headings in the subsequent page.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Split results</strong> field, accept <strong>No</strong>, which is the default, or
select <strong>Yes</strong>. A setting of <strong>No</strong> configures the action to
return data as a collection of values. That is,
the connection passes a collection of row objects or a collection of
column objects to the next step in the flow.
Select <strong>Yes</strong> to enable the connection to split the returned data
according to the setting of <strong>Major dimension</strong>. For example, if
<strong>Major dimension</strong> is set to <strong>Rows</strong> then the connection returns row
objects. Each row object triggers a separate execution of the flow.
That is, {prodname} executes the flow once for each returned row
object. For example, if the poll returns 5 rows then {prodname} executes
the flow 5 times.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} also provides discrete split and aggregate steps, which
you can add to a flow.
If you want to process individual objects in one or more steps and
then aggregate the row or column objects, do not split the Google Sheets
connection result. Instead, accept the default, <strong>No</strong>, and then add a
split step to the flow after this connection. A split step is
required if you want an aggregate step in the flow.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Delay</strong> field, accept the default of 30 seconds or
specify how often you want the connection to obtain spreadsheet data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Max results</strong> field, accept the default of <strong>0</strong> if you do not
want to restrict how many rows or columns polling can return. The setting
of <strong>Max results</strong> applies to the setting of the major dimension in the
result matrix. To limit the data that the connection returns for the
major dimension, specify an integer.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose that the major dimension is rows and that <strong>Max results</strong>
is set to <strong>25</strong>. The poll returns no more than 25 rows of values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <strong>Range</strong> specifies the major dimension and you also specify
<strong>Max results</strong>, polling uses the lower number to determine how much
data to return. Consequently, setting a value for <strong>Max results</strong> is
more helpful when you specify only the minor dimension for <strong>Range</strong>.
For example, consider a sheet that has 30 rows with three columns of
values in each row. Suppose that <strong>Major dimension</strong> is <strong>Rows</strong> and
<strong>Range</strong> is <strong>A:C</strong>. If you set <strong>Max results</strong> to <strong>10</strong>, polling returns
10 rows of data. If you accept <strong>0</strong> as the setting of <strong>Max results</strong>,
polling returns 30 rows. However, if you specify <strong>Range</strong> as <strong>A1:C15</strong>
and you also specify <strong>Max results</strong> as <strong>25</strong>, polling returns 15
rows. If you specify <strong>Range</strong> as <strong>A1:C30</strong> and you also
specify <strong>Max results</strong> as <strong>25</strong>, polling returns 25 rows.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Next</strong> to view the column names in the data that the connection
obtains when <strong>Major dimension</strong> is set to <strong>Rows</strong>. If <strong>Major dimension</strong> is
<strong>Columns</strong>, content in this field is ignored and you can click <strong>Next</strong>
now to complete this procedure.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The values that appear in the <strong>Column names</strong> field become the
field names that a data mapper step displays. If you specified a
header row number, {prodname} displays the headings from that
row in the sheet that you are obtaining data from. If you left
the header row number field blank, {prodname} displays a letter
(<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and so on) for each column in the range of
data that you are obtaining.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, edit the <strong>Column names</strong> field so it contains the
field names that you want to see in a data mapper step.
The field must contain a comma-separated list with no spaces,
for example, <code>Name,Address,City,State,Zip</code>.</p>
