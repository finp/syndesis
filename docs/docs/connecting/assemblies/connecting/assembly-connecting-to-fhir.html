<p>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard
for exchanging healthcare data. In an integration, you can
obtain one or more FHIR resources, create or update a
resource, update one or more fields in a resource, or use a
transaction to create multiple resources. To do this, add a FHIR
connection to the middle of a flow or as a simple integration&#8217;s
finish connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{prodname} connections to FHIR:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can communicate with FHIR servers that use basic or bearer token (OAuth) authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can operate on all FHIR resources that comply with FHIR DSTU3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot operate on extensions, which allow for storing custom data in a resource.
If an extension is in data that is received from a FHIR server, the integration
silently ignores it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an integration that connects to FHIR, in a data mapper step, you can map only
one level of depth for a FHIR list field. In other words, if a FHIR list contains
a list then you cannot map the fields in the nested list. To mitigate
this limitation, {prodname} converts some FHIR resource
list fields to single-value fields, for example, an address that is in
a list field might be displayed in the data mapper as a single field.</p>

<p>You must know the URL for the FHIR server that you want to connect to.</p>
</li>

<p>You must have authorization credentials for accessing the FHIR server.
You should obtain these from the FHIR server administrator.
Rarely, a FHIR server does not require authentication and you can
create a connection without specifying credentials. For example,
a public FHIR server or a FHIR server in a private network might
not require authentication.</p>

you specified how many fields to update. The data mapper
displays this number of folders in the <strong>Target</strong> panel. For example,

three target folders with the labels <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>Map a source field, constant, or property to the target

example, map this path <code>/name/1/given/1/value</code> to update the value
of the given name field.</p>
